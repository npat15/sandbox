This was a small project to see if I could develop a basic RPG-esque game in under two weeks. I was inspired by the 2D design of some of the earlier Pokemon games for GBA, and wanted to emulate that kind of pseudo-exloritory feel.

This framework includes basic map generation (using the STI library), collisions (using STI and the Bump library), and classes to generate and move a player, trigger basic map-related events (such as entering and exiting a building), and a very simple NPC logic and dialogue.

Requirements:
* Push
* STI
* Bump
* StateMachine.lua (https://howtomakeanrpg.com/)
